# untitled-weather-navigation-app

## Statement of Purpose

This application is intended to be a proof of concept that will allow user to view weather conditions that could adversely affectroad conditions along a specific route (possibly at the current time and) when they are expected to be at that location. Any extreme weather of a certain type at any point on their route during the entire expected duration of their trip will bereported as well. In addition to these largely qualtative data, the application will allow users to view real time radar data, which will be overlaid on the map displaying their route.

## APIs To Be Utilized:

- RainViewer API (for rader visualization)
- Google Maps API (for the underlying map, routing, trip logistics)
- National Weather Service API (weather conditions)
